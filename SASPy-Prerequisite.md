Java version 1.8.0_162 or higher, Python 3.3 or higher, and SASPy 3.3.4 or higher (using the latest version is recommended) are required before proceeding.
If your Python version is 3.4 or higher, pip is already installed.
If pip isn’t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library: 
**py -m ensurepip --default-pip**
If that still doesn’t allow you to run **python -m pip**
1. Securely Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
2. Run **python get-pip.py**. This will install or upgrade pip. Additionally, it will install setuptools and wheel if they’re not installed already.
